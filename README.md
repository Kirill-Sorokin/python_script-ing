# python_script(ing)
Lines of code, that perform a specific task. I developed this code to teach others. Nothing special, just a general idea of how python scripting works.

This is essentially a 'mock project' for others (students) to learn. (I will/am teaching them)

Covering a range of modules, including (not limited to):
- Command Line Arguments
- Copy files or Directories
- Search Files or Directories
- OS
- Sys
- Subprocess
